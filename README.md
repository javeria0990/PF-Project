# Paynix  
### *Your Trusted Digital Vault*

## 📌 Project Overview
**Paynix** is a desktop-based Personal Finance Management System developed as my **First Semester University Project**.  
The application enables users to manage balances, record transactions, and analyze monthly financial activity with accuracy and consistency.

While the official requirement of the semester project was to implement the system using **C++**, Paynix was designed using a **hybrid architecture**:  
- **C++ for core financial logic**
- **Flutter for the desktop application interface**

This approach ensured full academic compliance while also reflecting **real-world software engineering practices**.

---

## 🎓 Academic Context (First Semester Project)
Paynix was assigned as a **first semester project**, with the following constraints:

- Core logic implementation in **C++**
- Emphasis on logical correctness and problem-solving
- Team-based development

Before entering university, I already had a **strong practical grip on Flutter and Dart**, developed through self-learning and independent projects.  
Instead of limiting the project to a console-based C++ application, I intentionally chose to **leverage my prior Flutter expertise** to enhance the project’s usability and presentation.

To remain fully aligned with academic requirements:
- All **core calculations and financial logic** were written in C++
- Flutter executed this logic using **`process.run`**
- Output from C++ processes was captured, parsed, and reflected in the Flutter UI

This design satisfied the semester requirement **without bypassing C++**, while also demonstrating advanced integration skills.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Flutter (Desktop)**
- **Dart**
- **C++**
- **process.run (Flutter ↔ C++ communication)**
- **Git & GitHub (Version Control and Collaboration)**

## 💡 Why Flutter for a FinTech Application?
Flutter was selected deliberately for Paynix due to its reliability in **data-driven and transaction-based applications**.

Key reasons include:
- Predictable state management
- Consistent rendering and behavior
- High performance for desktop and mobile systems
- Strong ecosystem support

Flutter’s credibility in fintech is well established.  
Large-scale financial platforms and banking solutions have adopted Flutter for production systems (for example, major digital banking platforms developed under national banking ecosystems), demonstrating that Flutter is **stable, secure, and suitable for financial software**.

Paynix serves as a practical demonstration of Flutter’s suitability for fintech when paired with a clean architecture and robust backend logic.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview
Paynix follows a **clean, modular architecture**:

- **C++ Layer**  
  Handles financial calculations, validations, and transaction logic.

- **Flutter ViewModels**  
  Manage application state, balance synchronization, and business rules.

- **Flutter UI (Views)**  
  Provides a responsive, desktop-friendly user interface.

- **Process Integration**  
  Flutter communicates with C++ using `process.run`, ensuring:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Academic compliance
  - Real-world architectural relevance

---

## 👨‍💼 Leadership & Role
I served as the **Team Lead and Core Architect** of Paynix.

### My Responsibilities Included:
- Designing the overall system architecture
- Deciding the hybrid Flutter + C++ approach
- Implementing core transaction and balance logic
- Ensuring consistency across overview and monthly reports
- Reviewing teammates’ implementations
- Debugging critical financial calculation issues
- Managing GitHub branches, merges, and final integration
- Ensuring successful and stable project completion

All final technical decisions and validations were handled by me.

---

## 🤝 Team Collaboration via GitHub
The project was developed collaboratively using **GitHub**, following structured workflows:

- Clear task division among team members
- Independent development of assigned logic modules
- Regular commits with meaningful messages
- Code review and integration handled centrally
- Conflict resolution and logic alignment managed by the team lead

This resulted in a clean repository history and a stable final product.
